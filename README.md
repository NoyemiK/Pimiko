# Pimiko
The simple "PC-8801" text RPG Pimiko, for the Processing framework. You can use this as a tool to learn java and processing basics, or poke around and play the game!

## Some Extension Ideas

- Create an inventory system!
- Use a 2D dungeon with dynamic monster positions (you can move around... and they can too!)
- Create an equipment or skills system!
