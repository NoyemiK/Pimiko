# Pimiko

The simple Delmuncorp DM-82 ("PC-8801") text RPG Pimiko, for the Processing framework. Originally it functioned as a 3-hour project to help me teach myself how to program games, but I no longer recommend using this repository to help yourself learn Processing as of this commmit. Instead, follow my [Mimiho project](https://github.com/NoyemiK/Mimiho) instead, which includes more of what a game programmer might want and less of what they might not.

You can still play and enjoy the game (and its code) as a relic of DelmunSoft history!

## Dependencies

**If you're just playing the game**, you should get the latest version of Java (Java 8 as of this writing).

**If you're playing with the code**, you need to get the minim library from the contribution manager inside of the Processing IDE (go to `Tools > Add Tool...` and switch to the library tab):

## Some Extension Ideas

- Create an inventory system!
- Use a 2D dungeon with dynamic monster positions (you can move around... and they can too!)
- Create an equipment or skills system!
