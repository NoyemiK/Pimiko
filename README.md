# Pimiko

The simple Delmuncorp DM-82 ("PC-8801") text RPG Pimiko, for the Processing framework. Originally it functioned as a 3-hour project to help me teach myself how to program games, but I no longer recommend using this repository to help yourself learn Processing as of [commit fbe46cd](https://github.com/NoyemiK/Pimiko/commit/fbe46cd893bbd5e7aa1740ece300fea9cdc72e67). Instead, follow my [Mimiho project](https://github.com/NoyemiK/Mimiho), which includes more of what a game programmer might want and less of what they might not.

You can still play and enjoy the game (and its code) as a relic of DelmunSoft history!

## Dependencies

- **If you're just playing the game**, you should get the latest version of Java (Java 8 as of this writing).

- **If you're playing with the code**, you need to get the minim library from the contribution manager inside of the Processing IDE (go to `Tools > Add Tool...` and switch to the library tab):

## History

- **January 2012**: *Pimiko II* is originally a minigame inside of my first public game, ***Hell Diary***
- **December 2013**: First version of Pimiko, a primitive command-line based "original" made in pure Ruby over 3 days and packaged as an executable with OCRA
- **December 2015**: Pimiko is remade for Processing in 3 hours, completely from scratch
- **February 2016**: The processing version is uploaded to Github
- **December 2017**: ***Pimiko Plus***, an unrelated game with a similarly simplistic set of ideas, is released on Steam

## Some Extension Ideas

- Create an inventory system!
- Use a 2D dungeon with dynamic monster positions (you can move around... and they can too!)
- Create an equipment or skills system!
